## Pending — findings

### [5.4] The book screen's tab title never names the open book [x]
- category: a11y
- impact: 6 (the web build's tab/bookmark/shared-link title read "Mood Read" for every open book, a literal
  WCAG 2.4.2 "Page Titled" miss on the app's one genuinely dynamic, most-visited route)
- ease: 9 (book.title is already in scope at the screen's return; the fix is two JSX lines)
- seen: 2026-10-26 (/iterate, cloud march tick)
- issue: #10
- fixed: 2026-10-26 (/march, /iterate) — `src/app/book/[id].tsx` now sets `<Stack.Screen options={{ title: book.title }} />` for the native header and `<Head><title>{book.title}</title></Head>` (expo-router's Head) for the web document title, once the book loads; `e2e/player.spec.ts` asserts `page.title()` names the open book instead of the app's static default.

### [4.4] The web build keeps any number of books offline; spec 05 caps it at one [x]
- category: correctness
- impact: 4 (spec 05 Design, "The web build streams; phones keep": a browser keeps at most one book and its
  pieces and says so in Downloads; 05.4 caps playlists at one book, but book downloads and imports are not capped,
  so a browser's storage quota can evict them unannounced)
- ease: 5 (apply 05.4's one-at-a-time rule to book files on web, through 05.7's `removeDownload`)
- seen: 2026-10-25 (05.7 builder, heads-down arcturus)
- issue: #7
- fixed: 2026-10-25 (/march, /iterate) � on web, a book that lands (import, LibriVox download, "Find the file") takes
  the place of the one on the device: the other goes through `removeDownload`, so it stays on the shelf "Not on
  device" and keeps its position, bookmarks, moods, picks and mix (`booksToEvict`, `newlyOnDevice`, `enforceLimit`
  in `src/lib/book-removal.ts`, wired in `src/lib/library-manage.ts`); the Downloads web note says so. Phones: no cap.

### [4.5] Wi-Fi only gates on the setting alone: the queue never reads the network [x]
- category: correctness
- impact: 4 (with Wi-Fi only on, a phone on mobile data still downloads books and playlist pieces, since
  `onWifi` is never passed to the app's queue and defaults to true)
- ease: 5 (pass an `onWifi` from a network-status module, e.g. expo-network, in `src/lib/downloads.ts`, and
  re-run the queue when the network changes)
- seen: 2026-10-25 (05.4 builder, heads-down arcturus)
- issue: #5
- fixed: 2026-10-25 (/march, /iterate) — `src/lib/network.ts` binds expo-network; the download queue and the verdict
  sender both read `onWifi` from it and re-run when the network changes (`src/lib/network-watch.ts` holds the rules).

### [4.2] A chapter is reached (and its pieces logged) only while the book's screen is open [x]
- category: correctness
- impact: 4 (playback that runs into the next chapter while the listener is on another screen leaves that chapter
  unreached, so its emotions, its fingerprint share and its soundtrack entry wait until the book is opened again)
- ease: 6 (move `reached.reach` and the soundtrack log from `src/app/book/[id].tsx` into `PlayerProvider`)
- seen: 2026-10-24 (07.8 builder, heads-down rigel)
- issue: #8
- fixed: 2026-10-25 (/march, /iterate) - playback now reaches a chapter, moves its place and logs its pieces in
  `PlayerProvider`, decided by `recordPlayback` in `src/lib/chapter-reach.ts` (the book screen no longer does it);
  each store step is idempotent, so nothing logs twice. `e2e/soundtrack.spec.ts` rolls a chapter over from the shelf.

### [4.0] Verdicts keyed by chapter index can light on the wrong chapter after a chapter edit [x]
- category: correctness
- impact: 4 (a merge or split shifts indices, so a kept "Fits" or "Doesn't fit" can show on another chapter that
  plays the same piece; 07.5 would then send it with the wrong chapter's emotions)
- ease: 7 (clear a book's `verdicts:` in the chapter-edit path, or match the chapter title as scores do)
- seen: 2026-10-24 (07.4 builder, heads-down rigel)
- issue: #9
- fixed: 2026-10-25 (/march, /iterate) - a merge or split now moves the book's verdicts with its chapters, as it does their beds: a merge keeps the first chapter's verdicts and drops the second's, a split keeps them on the first half, and later chapters' shift with them (`verdictsAfterMerge`, `verdictsAfterSplit` in `src/lib/verdict-store.ts`, wired by `src/lib/chapter-edits.ts`). A verdict that still applies is kept, none is wiped.

### [4.5] The web export puts package assets under dist/assets/node_modules/, which Pages never uploads [x]
- category: tooling
- impact: 4 (any asset a package ships, such as expo-router's own images or a font loaded from its package, 404s on mood-read.pages.dev while it works locally and in e2e)
- ease: 5 (copy such assets into `assets/` as 06.4 did for Bricolage Grotesque, with a byte-equality test, or rename the folder after `expo export`)
- seen: 2026-10-23 (06.4: the display face, moved to assets/fonts; expo-router's assets still sit there, unrequested today)
- issue: #6
- fixed: 2026-10-25 (/march, /iterate) — `scripts/web-export-paths.mjs` runs after `expo export` (in `pnpm build` and `e2e:owner`): the 18 expo-router assets move to
  `assets/vendor/<package>/` and every reference in the bundle follows, and it fails if a node_modules path is left; `e2e/web-export.spec.ts` and the e2e guard check that none is exported or requested.

### [5.4] Two sessions' gates collide on e2e port 4173 [x]
- category: tooling
- impact: 5 (a parallel session's e2e holds 127.0.0.1:4173, so another session's `git commit` hook fails red with "is already used"; seen three times in one evening)
- ease: 6 (`playwright.config.ts` takes `E2E_PORT` and the hook or `scripts/` picks a free port per worktree)
- issue: #4
- fixed: 2026-10-25 (/iterate, cloud march tick) — `playwright.config.ts` picks a free port automatically (commit 601102b)
  (`scripts/e2e-port.mjs`: a seed derived from the worktree path, probed upward for one that's actually free)
  when `E2E_PORT` is unset, so two worktrees' gates no longer need to coordinate a port by hand.
